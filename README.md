Energy Usage Optimization Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing energy consumption using AI-driven analytics and predictive modeling. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system identifies inefficiencies, predicts usage patterns, and recommends actionable insights to reduce energy waste and operational costs.

Objectives

Analyze historical energy usage data to detect patterns and anomalies.

Develop predictive models to forecast energy consumption.

Implement optimization strategies to reduce overall energy expenditure.

Provide real-time monitoring and reporting dashboards.

Features

Predictive Analytics: Uses machine learning to forecast future energy usage.

Real-time Monitoring: Tracks energy consumption in real-time.

Optimization Algorithms: Recommends adjustments to reduce unnecessary energy usage.

Customizable Dashboards: Visual representation of energy data for easy interpretation.

Automated Alerts: Notifies users of abnormal consumption patterns.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python, R

Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib

Cloud Platforms: IBM Watson, AWS, Azure

Data Sources: IoT sensors, historical energy logs, weather data APIs
